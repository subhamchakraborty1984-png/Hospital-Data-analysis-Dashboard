# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
We need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in EXCEL to improve efficiency and provide useful insights. This dashboard will help stakeholders monitor, analyze, and make better decisions for managing patients and improving services.
## Charts to create
Patient Admission Status: Show how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted.

Patient Age Distribution: Group patients by age.

Timeliness: Measure the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.

Gender Analysis: Display the number of patients by gender. 

Department Referrals: Check which departments patients are referred to the most.
